## Meetup "Clone" Using React and Data Fetch

Reinvention of popular events and social networking app

Features a listing of events viewable as a feed, by meetup group or individually and contains user login and dynamic RSVP functionality. Front-end interface developed with Bootstrap, React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Uses WordPress REST API to fetch back end content from provided API endpoints and render dynamically to user interface. Makes use of React Router and Context to efficiently pass state as props to nested components and update state based on user actions.
